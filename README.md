# UX-Search
**This project will attempt to enhance stock content search at Adobe Stock with a focus on exposing tags, a key set of available metadata not currently used, to the user and encouraging multimedia queries of both keywords and an image.**
### Installing
`git clone the repository.`
`cd UX-Search`
`npm update`
### Branches
| Main Branches | version | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------:|:-------------:|
| `master`      |   1.1   |**main branch**|
| `dev`         |   2.1   |  development  |

We decided on a GitFlow approach. We have master as our main branch and then have dev be our development branch. We branch off of dev to fix bugs and develop features. We then push back to dev when features are satisfactory. We then push to master when we have accomplished an important feature that we would like to have as the release.

`master` has these latest features:
<ul>
    <li> Basic search by query</li>
</ul>

`dev` has these latest features:
<ul>
    <li> Basic search by query </li>
    <li> Pagination </li>
</ul>
